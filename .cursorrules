# Automated Task Processing

IMPORTANT: There is a task file that needs your attention.

## Task File Location
D:\Users\socce\Desktop\KWD Dev\Kwd_dev\client-websites\jacks-roofing-llc\CURSOR_TASK.md

## Instructions
1. Read the CURSOR_TASK.md file in this workspace
2. Follow all instructions in that file
3. Implement the required changes
4. Test your changes locally (run the app and check for errors)
5. Commit your changes locally when complete
6. DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB. The workflow tool will handle the push after manual approval.

## Expected Behavior
You should automatically start working on the task described in CURSOR_TASK.md when this workspace opens.
